# flang

flang is a lisp implementation that follows the [mal](https://github.com/kanaka/mal) process but does not strictly adheres to it.

flang is implemented in Rust and is based on the Rust implementation of mal by
[Joel Martin](https://github.com/kanaka).

## Running
```
cargo run --bin flang
user> (print "hello world")
hello world
```
